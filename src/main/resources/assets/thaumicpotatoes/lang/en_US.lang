guide.1.1.1=Year 2017.\nSeveral months ago, a wild fire spread across the continent. Everything in its way were burned to a crisp: Trees, buildings, books, or people...well not exactly everything, but yeah, almost everything. Those who survived quickly repopulated. Some picked up skills they learned in the 
guide.1.1.2=past, some proceeds to live a new life. Just in a few months, the society returned stable, maybe even stabler than the times before the fire.\nBut some things are, inevitably, gone. You know, books burn up pretty fast. Thaumonomicon, the one and only scripture of  
guide.1.1.3=Thaumaturgy, turned into a pile of dark ashes. Thaumaturges worldwide were obviously disappointed, but most continued to live their lives without thaumaturgy. Of course, we have various kinds of technology and other branches of magic in this new era. Plenty of choices available.
guide.1.1.4=Since then, The bygone art of working wonders - Thaumaturgy, is long forgotten.

guide.1.2.1=Many copies of Thaumonomicon exist, in the hands of many different thaumaturges. Most of them were burnt in the fire - that ranges from archmage Azanor's original manuscripts to any random amateur thaumaturges' copy which they use to remember their crucible recipes.
guide.1.2.2=However, there is one copy of Thaumonomicon that survived the fire. While it's dirty and broken with multiple black stains on its pages, there is no trace of it being burnt before. 
guide.1.2.3=All but one sentence were covered in a nasty layer of stains, crust and slime. It is already unreadable without the help of the fire.
guide.1.2.4=The only sentence on its last page remained clear and readable. \n"Potatoes will unleash that thirst onto the future."

guide.1.3.1=I have always been fascinated by the mystical powers of thaumaturgy. I made up my mind to be a thaumaturge ever since I watched a man making exquisite crafts with his infusion altar. The particles flying in the air, the jingles of shaking warded jars, the glowing 
guide.1.3.2=purple runes on the ground, and the smell - the smell of unadulterated, pure magic. It's everything I wished it to be.
guide.1.3.3=The fire burned all my will to live. My country, my family, my face, my identity, my hope - everything was stolen from me, and I have no power to fight back. I can't describe how happy I am when I found an unburnt thaumonomicon in the debris. This is it. 
guide.1.3.4=This will be the one and only hope I have, the one and only excuse to continue living on this pathetic world. I will resurrect Thaumaturgy. I will be the first thaumaturge of this era, and the last of all past history.


guide.1.4.1=I have been reading through this copy of thaumonomicon I found. It stats that potatoes are very effective catalysts of thaumaturgy. I tried, but it didn't work. This book is outdated anyways, I suspect that modern potatoes are not capable of carrying heavy magical powers. 
guide.1.4.2=Maybe if I dig deep underground, I can find fossils of pre-1.8.9 potatoes which have the capability to channel magical energies.
guide.1.4.3=*Petrified Potato Ore is found deep underground, They only spawn in places lower than y=30. When mined they will drop several petrified potatoes. They are not edible anymore - technically they probably are, but they are going to taste like stone anyways.


guide.1.5.1=These petrified potatoes are definitely the ones existed before the fire. They don't seem to be alive though. They are now more stone than potato. I'm thinking, if I heat them up with a furnace, will they turn back to life?
guide.1.5.3=*Thaumic Potatoes are edible. They give you speed boosts for a short time due to their magical properties, but they are not exactly fulfilling.
guide.1.5.4=This is exactly what I was looking for. Ancient potatoes with a thaumaturge's emblem seared onto its skin. I can smell it. The smell of thaumaturgy - raw magical power. I'm sure I can apply this material to my new researches and move one step forward to my goal.


guide.2.1.1=I'm hungry. I just happen to have a lot of potatoes for my thaumaturgical researches, why not put some of them to another use? I can make some simple potato soup with milk and potatoes. It'll definitely be more fulfilling than plain baked potatoes.

guide.2.2.1=I should try some exotic cuisines sometimes. With the starch from potatoes, I should be able to make some better dough by mixing them with some wheat. I'll cut the dough into tiny squares and fill them up with meat.\nThat's wicked.

guide.2.3.1=In the past, thaumaturges distill various materials and gather the very basic elements that made up things - essentia. I think I can do the same thing with my potatoes.
guide.2.3.2=It worked. Though for some strange reason the essentia I distilled don't have to stay in a warded jar to exist, and it seems to be edible. I guess that's an improvement to the old technique, eh? Still, drinking it makes me feel dizzy.

guide.2.4.1=I tried to deep fry a whole potato with seed oil, but it didn't turn out pretty. The core is not cooked at all and the outside is burnt already. If I strip them into bars though, will it work better?
guide.2.4.2=Excellent. Now the whole thing is fried. I think I just invented obesity and deliciousness together in a pack. Screw it, we are all going to die at some point, why not have a pack of fries before it? \nBone Apple Tea!

guide.2.5.1=Carbs are important. We need energy to survive, and carbohydrate is about the best way to ingest calories. I'm thinking about cooking a massive chunk of starch and bring them out to exhausting mining trips with me. Should be a day's energy within a single ball.
guide.2.5.2=I made it. It is obviously very fulfilling, but the taste is not so great. It tastes like...nothing. Just plain starch, nothing else. Like solid air. But my assumptions were correct, I don't have to eat other things for a day after munching down this monstrosity.
guide.2.5.3=Or maybe for a week, or more.

guide.3.1.1=I think I might be able to make a better metal by combining iron with the thaumic potatoes. The starch of potatoes should be able to enhance its hardness and durability, and the magical properties of thaumic potatoes will enhance its enchantability.
guide.3.1.2=Good, everything turned out to be expected. The result metal is an ideal choice to build any tool on. Well almost any.

guide.3.2.1=I proudly name my new inventions potatools. Better durability and speed then iron tools, this will be the new staple tool for everyone. For some reason I can't make an axe out of it, but all other tools work. Fine, I'll just make a sharper shovel and call it an axe.
guide.3.2.2=*The "Axpade" is a special 2-in-1 tool. While you can use it like a shovel, it is also sharp enough to chop trees down. It's not suggested to smack it in your enemy's face though, as it's not designed for combat. 
guide.3.2.3=*One more thing, when you are desperately hungry deep in a mineshaft, you can even eat them! Simply craft them into mashed potatoes by hand, then you are in for a quick and messy feast.

guide.3.3.1=I always wished to bring more things with me. My backpack fills up too quickly, no matter I'm building or mining. If I can make some sort of portable storage...I know! With the magical properties of thaumic potatoes, they can make regular fiber 
guide.3.3.2=carry much heavier heavier weight. If I can weave strings with thaumic potatoes and make the result fiber into a handbag, I will be able to carry much more things with me.
guide.3.3.3=The result is amazing. I can fill a whole chest's content into the bag easily, and carrying it feels like nothing! The possibilities of potatoes and thaumaturgy is truly infinite.

guide.3.4.1=I have been thinking about a way to transform my poisonous potatoes into normal potatoes. Throughout numerous times of experiments, I still haven't figured it out.\nHowever, the oppisite...seems to be achievable.
guide.3.4.2=I don't think this is useful at all. But hey, maybe it won't be after I found a way to uilize these useless poisonous potatoes?

guide.4.1.1=I should be able to make weapons with my newly invented potato alloy as well. This time I will cover a layer of thaumic potatoes on an iron sword. If succeed, the blade should turn way harder and more durable than it ever will be.
guide.4.1.2=I went overboard and dipped the whole thing into thaumic potatoes. Turns out great. Just like the tools, the sword can now withstand more swings and deal more damage. \nThere's one thing I wonder, where did the bloodstain come from...?

guide.4.2.1=On the old Thaumonomicon I scavenged, there is a page that stats freezing a blade of potato will overclock it and make it even sharper. Infusion was used in the book, but I'll just do it with brute force.
guide.4.2.2=It's brilliant. The sword does not feel any heavier, but the blows it delivers is surely deadlier.\n*Once frozen, the potato cleaver gains unlimited durability.

guide.4.3.1=As a thaumaturge, I really should start learning some actual spells, rather than relying on those barbaric melee weapons. I have an idea. By channeling the magical power inside potatoes, I might be able to accelerate them to high, deadly velocities.
guide.4.3.2=However, there's one technical problem: flying at such a high speed, normal potatoes will easily break apart midair. I also need to make harder, more durable potatoes as my projectiles.
guide.4.3.3=This is it. Finally a stylish magical weapon for me to fend off my enemies.\nThis staff allows rapid fire of high speed potatoes, making ranged battle an ease.\nAdditionally, using Reinforced Poisonous Potatoes as ammos will poison the target. Baked ones will set them on fire.

guide.4.4.1=I'm having a problem where I often have to make many pairs of iron shears for various usages. These little clipping blades sure are useful, but they break too quick. If I can attach two pairs of potato cleavers together, maybe I can create a pair of unbreakable shears.
guide.4.4.2=Here's it. I call it the P-Alloy Tactical Shears. With two potato cleavers as its blades, and various materials for its base and handle, this thing is objectively indestructable.
guide.4.4.3=It can be used as a pair of shears with unlimited durability. The sharp blades make up for excellent weapons themselves.\nWhat's more, the pincer mechanism of the grip gives thie weapon a special charged attack, which can be unleashed by long holding right click.
guide.4.4.4=The powerful charged slash of two blades can chop everything apart. It deals massive damage and sends enemies flying.\nAdditonally, if a monster has a choppable head, using this special move to defeat it will always drop its head.\nFailing to fully charge will yield no damage.
guide.4.4.5=You can still shear your sheep with this thing, but caution should be taken because you might slice it in two.

guide.5.1.1=My head hurts. Could be hangover from too much vodka yesterday, or too much carb in my diet. I don't know. I really don't. It feels like someone is smashing my skull with a hammer. Without the injury but double the pain. I can't breath, in any second I could p a s s
guide.5.1.2=*When we are going to harvest and in your heart and your mind you feel that you will have to export the potato and you are not going to see it anymore you can taste the sea the church and the sun you can feel that you are eating potatoes
guide.5.1.3=Two people look at clouds. One see potato. The other see impossible dream. \nIt's the same cloud.
guide.5.3.1=*Someone before me had done this. The very same thing. And I guess, will be the very same outcome. \nYou will be no exception.
guide.5.3.2=Yeah, the things on the previous page. I have noticed that in many of the entries, I didn't write them by my own. The ideas are mine, but when looking back, some sentences aren't from me.
guide.5.3.3=It's like someone else is writing this book, adding annotations to things I don't quite understand, or fixing my grammar errors.
guide.5.3.4=*like this? \nYeah...Wait what? \n*You are not the only one. Not the first, and will not be the last.

guide.5.4.1=*It's your choice. Either way, blood will be spilled.

guide.6.1.2=A veil has been lifted - a door opened in my mind.\nWhen I look through I see potatoes.\nNo, not potatoes\n*SHOW THEM ALL I WILL SHOW THEM ALL\n*WHAT I SEE WHAT I SEE I SEE I SE
guide.6.1.3=I have potato blood in my veins.\nMy life, is potato.\nIn your living life and your working, it's always potatoes.\nI dream of potatoes.

guide.6.2.1=And then here's this broken book.\nI don't think it's readable anymore...but I feel an extremely strong urge to open this book. I can hear it, someone else is calling my name inside it.
