Thaumic Potatoes 2 is the successor to my old mod, Thaumic Potatoes for MC 1.8.9. Note that this mod is not a Thaumcraft addon, as Thaumcraft doesn't even exist in 1.11.2/1.12. However it is kind of an addon for Guide-API as it's necessary for the guide books to load. The aim of this mod is to add interesting, potato-themed features into the game. Right now however very few are added.

Notice that only the 1.12 version of the mod's source is uploaded. The old 1.11.2 codes were really messy so they are opted out.
